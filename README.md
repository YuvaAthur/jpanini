Simple Datu prakriya coding using J

 Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī is a monumental effort that has, on one side, unified Vedic and Conventional Sanskrit of that age, and, on the other side, is an extensible system that describes how Sanskrit Syntax works. As several Sanskrit scholars have observed, Pāṇini has created a comprehensive treatise around sounds, phonemes, syllables, words and sentences.
 In this project I have explored coding Datu prakriya - particularly  ItSamjya to understand what basic operators are required to implement such a word morphology.
